Data collection, cleaning, and analysis for Senior Thesis Ver. 1

This repository represents all the underlying code of my senior thesis: "User-attempted Algorithm Control on TikTok- Disability Awareness and Blackout Day" version 1. Data collection was scraped in Python through the use of TikTokApi package by David Teather (code can be found on GitHub) slightly modified in order to ensure compatibility of mac OS Big Sur while the majority of cleaning and analysis was done in R. Both pdf versions of exclusively data figures/visualizations as well as the version 1 thesis for convenient comparison.
